This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a roller coaster dataset. The analysis examines various features of roller coasters, such as their speed, height, inversions, g-force, and the year they were introduced.

The data visualization is performed using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, offering a deep dive into the relationships between different roller coaster attributes. By analyzing these features, we aim to uncover trends and insights, such as how coaster designs have evolved over time and how physical characteristics like height and speed relate to rider experiences like g-force and inversions.

Key Features:
Import and cleanup of roller coaster data.
Pairplot matrix visualization to explore correlations between features.
Differentiation between wood and steel roller coasters for comparative analysis.
Graphical exploration of coaster statistics across time.
Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute!
