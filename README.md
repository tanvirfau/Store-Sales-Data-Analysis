In this project I have analyzed a store's data of annual sales 2022 using Excel. Data cleaning and pivot tables are used to analyze relationships between available data sets. After completing the analysis the following insights are taken into consideration:

 Women are more likely  to buy compared to men ( ~ 64%)<br />
 Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states ( ~ 35%) <br />
 Adult age group (30-49 yrs) is max contributing ( ~50%) <br />
 Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels are max contributing (~80%) <br />

Final conclusion to improve store sales:

Target women customers of age group (30-49 yrs) living in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh by showing ads/offers/coupons availablee on Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra.
